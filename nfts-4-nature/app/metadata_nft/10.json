    "description": "My art is deeply inspired by nature, exploring themes such as love, freedom, equality and the preservation of the environment. I am a self-taught Brazilian, with a diverse trajectory in the creation of different forms of art. Recently, my focus has been on digital drawings, especially in the creation of mixed works that integrate digital art with artificial intelligence. My works have already been exhibited in cities such as Geneva, New York, Munich, Tokyo, and one of my pieces is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Science and Technology in Chiapas, Mexico.",
